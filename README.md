# Walmart Inventory Optimization Project

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective**: Walmart aims to enhance inventory management by implementing real-time demand forecasting, minimizing stockouts, and optimizing inventory levels across stores. This data-driven approach focuses on customer demand forecasting, external factors like weather, and promotional impact.

## Problem Definition

Walmart needs a data-driven inventory optimization solution that minimizes both stockouts and overstocking by forecasting demand based on past sales data. The goal is to develop a scalable approach that adjusts inventory levels dynamically using real-time insights from the analysis.
